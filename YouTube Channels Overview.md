#### ♂ [書道家 東宮たくみ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrMST-VTtx4SYr8CNJHsbnQ)
Videos about caligraphy with brush, ballpoint pen, brush pen etc. Not that good to learn from as he doesn’t have many explanation videos but nice to copy things from.
#### ♀ [静芳（せいほう）のYouTube書塾](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAcnIP_u8vDfH0_0Z07WbKw)
Very good for getting into 書道・習字. She has a lot of explanations with great demonstrations
#### ♀ [ゆめふで美文字チャンネル](https://www.youtube.com/@yumefude/videos)
Similar to the above but not as well produced and informative I feel like but I haven’t watched enough to say for sure
